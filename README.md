# PlantGrowthAnalysisImageProcessingML

The Project deals with the images of the leaves of different plants. The Leaves are categorized into different growth phases. These phases are tagged with the images and their corresponding species names. These images are fed to machine learning algorithm which performs a voting type of classification among prominent algorithms and predicts the species name and the growth phase.
This has been implemented using Server Client type of architecture to reduce overload on the user device
